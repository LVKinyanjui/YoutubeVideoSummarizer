# What is this?

This project uses either a gradio or streamlit interface to allow us to interact with youtube video data.
We provide the youtube video url and get all the comments from the Youtube Data API.

As per now, getting comments is the main feature. You can also get a summary of the comments with the gradio ui. More features will be added with the evolution of the project.
