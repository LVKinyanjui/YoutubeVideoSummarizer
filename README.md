# What is this?

This project uses either a streamlit interface to allow us to interact with youtube video data.
We provide the youtube video url and get all the comments from the Youtube Data API.

### Summary
A summary feature has been added that uses the refine technique on all the extracted comments.

### Difficulties
Sometimes the build process on streamlit.io has failed with this error

This is supposedly due to the project's root directory being cluttered. The main file is meant to be moved to its own subdirectory in future.
